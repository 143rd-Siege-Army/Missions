# 143rd Arma 3 Operations Repository

## About
This is the 143rd Siege Army's missions repository. Hopefully all missions by all mission makers will be pushed here at some point, and automatically synced to the server.

## Commit Practices
- Ensure your missions are properly binned
- Ensure your missions include a `description.ext`, a `cbasettings.sqf`, and if required: `init.sqf` and `initserver.sqf`
- Ensure your mission PBOs are pushed to the correct PBOs folder

### Mission Folder Setup
- An example mission will be provided shortly, but folder structure should be followed for simplicity

#### Contributing
- To contribute, join the 143rd Mission Staff! We'd love to have you.
