A PREVIOUSLY DEPLOYED VALHALLAN REGIMENT HAS FAILED THEIR DUTY IN REMOVING THE XENOS FROM THE PLANET, AND HAVE FELL TO THEIR INSIDIOUS LIES.

THE VALHALLAN REGIMENT HAS DEPLOYED A NAVAL WING, WHILST THE TAUS HAVE DEPLOYED A LARGE AMOUNT OF ARMOUR. EXPECT HEAVY RESISTANCE FROM LARGER, NUMERICALLY SUPERIOR FORCES.

NAVAL INTELLIGENCE HAS NOTED THAT MANY SMALLER TOWNS HAVE BECOME NESTS FOR THE HERETICAL REGIMENT, WITH DEPLOYMENT OF DUG-IN POSITIONS AND PRE-RANGED MORTARS.
